// Add another puzzle to the bedroom, involving more of the furniture
++ Add a puzzle / item you can pick up in the hallway
// Make the hallway flicker less frequently (and more randomly?)
// The inventory crashes if it has more than one of the same item and you try to remove that item. (partially fixed by making sure there is never more than one item of the same type..)
// We need more interaction
// Bedroom drawer says you need an item even after finishing the puzzle. Should say 'Messages.NoHotspot' / Disable hotspot
/// Explicitly say noStroke in inventory render. (And other places where you don't need a stroke so other render methods don't fuck you up) (fixed only in inventory scene)
