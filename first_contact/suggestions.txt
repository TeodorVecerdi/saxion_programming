Coffee machine is cable broken, you get tape to fix the cable when you
do the xylophone puzzle opening the drawer. The coffee machine needs water.
There will be a poster next to the coffee machine telling you that and also
a flashing LED if the machine has power.

Radio has multiple channels with static noise and when you get the correct
channel the song plays. To finish the challenge you have to replay the same 
song on the xylophone.

++ Add another puzzle to the bedroom, involving more of the furniture

++ Make the hallway flicker less frequently (and more randomly?)
!! The inventory crashes if it has more than one of the same item and you
    try to remove that item.
++ We need more interaction
!! Bedroom drawer says you need an item even after finishing the puzzle.

    you don't need a stroke so other render methods don't fuck you up)
